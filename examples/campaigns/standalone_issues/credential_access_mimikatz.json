  "description": "Mimikatz post-exploitation tool was executed on domain controller DC02.company.local (10.10.10.20) at 2024-11-19 14:52:38 UTC with command-line arguments 'mimikatz.exe privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonpasswords exit'. The tool successfully dumped credentials from LSASS memory including 23 plaintext passwords, 47 NTLM hashes, and 15 Kerberos tickets for domain accounts including 3 Domain Admin credentials. Mimikatz was executed by user account backup_admin@company.local which recently showed signs of compromise through impossible travel login from Russia. The executable mimikatz.exe (MD5: d8b0e9e0e3d3f7c0a3c5e7f9b1d3e5f7) was dropped in C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ and executed with SeDebugPrivilege enabled. Network activity shows subsequent NTLM relay attacks to additional servers using stolen credentials. This represents a critical breach with administrative credential compromise.",
