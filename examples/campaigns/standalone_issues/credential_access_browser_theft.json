  "description": "Suspicious terminal process cmd.exe spawned python.exe which accessed Google Chrome's Login Data SQLite database containing saved passwords on workstation LAPTOP-DEV-089 (10.30.45.92) at 2024-11-24 11:18:35 UTC. The Python script 'credential_dumper.py' executed by user robert.taylor@company.com read 127 stored credentials from Chrome's encrypted credential store located at C:\\Users\\robert.taylor\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data. The script successfully decrypted credentials using Windows DPAPI (Data Protection API) and exported them to credentials_export.txt. This behavior is consistent with credential harvesting tools like LaZagne, Mimikatz, and custom credential stealers. The python.exe process (PID 4892) was spawned from cmd.exe (PID 3341) which originated from an Excel macro-enabled document attachment_invoice.xlsm opened 3 minutes prior. Network activity shows subsequent connections to command and control server 45.142.212.61 (Romania) immediately after credential extraction.",
