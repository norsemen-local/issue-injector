  "description": "Administrator account it_admin@company.com executed PowerShell command Remove-MailboxExportRequest to delete mailbox export request logs from Exchange Online at 2024-11-20 08:15:22 UTC. The command 'Remove-MailboxExportRequest -Identity \"CEO Mailbox Export\" -Confirm:$false' was executed via Exchange Online PowerShell module to remove evidence of a previous mailbox data export operation. The original export request extracted 4.2 GB of email data from the CEO's mailbox to a PST file 3 hours earlier. Removing mailbox export logs is suspicious as it eliminates audit trail of data exfiltration activities. The IT admin account accessed Exchange from IP address 91.219.29.150 (Ukraine) which is outside normal operational geography. No legitimate change request or compliance requirement exists for removing these export logs. This activity pattern is consistent with insider threats attempting to cover tracks after unauthorized data access.",
