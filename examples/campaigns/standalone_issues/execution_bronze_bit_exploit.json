  "description": "A forwardable Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for a Protected User account admin_privileged@company.local was observed being used for delegation on domain controller DC03.company.local at 2024-11-11 21:15:47 UTC. This indicates a Bronze-Bit exploit (CVE-2020-17049) where an attacker manipulates the Forwardable flag in Kerberos tickets to bypass Protected Users security group restrictions. Protected Users are supposed to be immune to delegation attacks, but this vulnerability allows attackers to create forwardable tickets despite security protections. The malicious ticket was requested by service account svc_web@company.local from client workstation ATTACKER-LAPTOP-01 (192.168.88.73). Analysis shows the attacker used modified Rubeus tool to craft the malicious ticket with forwardable flag set. The compromised privileged account has Domain Admin rights and access to all production servers. This exploit enables privilege escalation and lateral movement across the entire Active Directory environment.",
