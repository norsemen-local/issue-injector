  "description": "A file with embedded Unicode Right-to-Left Override (RLO) character (U+202E) was detected on workstation WKS-MARKETING-12 (10.20.30.45) at 2024-11-10 09:23:17 UTC. The file 'Financial_Report\u202efdp.exe' was downloaded from external website hxxps://malicious-cdn.example[.]com/documents/ by user mjohnson@company.local via Google Chrome. The RLO character (U+202E) reverses the display order of characters, making the malicious executable 'exe.pdf' appear as innocent PDF 'Financial_Report.pdf' in Windows Explorer and email clients. When the user clicked the file at 09:24 UTC, it executed payload disguised as Adobe Reader update, establishing C2 connection to 185.220.101.58:443 (TOR exit node) and downloading additional malware stage 'svchost32.dll' to %APPDATA%\\Local\\Temp\\. The technique bypasses basic security awareness training and exploits human trust in file extensions. File analysis shows embedded XOR-encrypted shellcode with Cobalt Strike beacon signature. The user mjohnson previously received targeted spearphishing email with subject 'Q4 Financial Results - Urgent Review' containing this malicious attachment.",
