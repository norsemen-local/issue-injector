  "description": "Palo Alto Networks firewall PA-3220-FW01 detected critical data exfiltration from workstation MKTG-WKS-024 (10.30.35.148) where DeerStealer infostealer uploaded 4.2MB of stolen credentials to attacker C2 server exfil-api[.]live (194.147.35[.]92, Netherlands). Network forensics show HTTPS POST request to hxxps://exfil-api[.]live/api/v2/upload at 14:27:15 UTC, 3 minutes after credential harvesting completion. Deep packet inspection revealed suspicious characteristics: (1) User-Agent header 'DeerClient/2.1.5' (custom infostealer client), (2) Content-Type: multipart/form-data containing encrypted ZIP archive (cache_tmp.zip), (3) HTTP header 'X-Campaign-ID: clickfix_nov2025' tracking infection source, (4) Request size 4.2MB single upload (no chunking), (5) TLS SNI extension to newly registered domain exfil-api[.]live (registered 2025-11-18, 9 days old). SSL decryption analysis shows encrypted payload structure: victim fingerprint (machine GUID, hostname, username), stolen credential inventory (173 browser passwords, 1,247 cookies, 2 cryptocurrency wallets, Discord tokens), system reconnaissance data (installed software, network config, screenshots). Server response HTTP 200 OK with JSON body: {'status': 'success', 'victim_id': 'a8f3e2c1-d9b4-f5a6-e7c8-d9f0a1b2c3d4', 'timestamp': 1732717635, 'data_size': 4404019} confirming successful exfiltration. Threat intelligence correlation: exfil-api[.]live shares registration infrastructure with browser-verification[.]live and cdn-updates[.]live (all Namecheap, registered 2025-11-18 through 2025-11-20), indicating coordinated ClickFix campaign infrastructure. Traffic pattern shows one-way communication: single POST upload, no subsequent C2 commands, typical fire-and-forget infostealer behavior. Firewall Advanced Threat Prevention blocked exfiltration (inline blocking enabled after Alert #6) but full 4.2MB transfer completed before block took effect - attacker received stolen data. Post-block analysis shows PowerShell attempting 3 reconnection attempts (14:27:47, 14:28:19, 14:28:51) all successfully blocked.",
