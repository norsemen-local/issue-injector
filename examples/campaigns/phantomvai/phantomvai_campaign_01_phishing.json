  "description": "Phishing email detected targeting user mthomas@techcorp.local with subject 'URGENT: Outstanding Invoice #INV-2024-8821 - Payment Required'. The email impersonates legitimate vendor 'Global Suppliers Ltd' and contains malicious ZIP attachment 'Invoice_8821.zip' (12KB) with obfuscated JavaScript file inside. Email originated from spoofed sender payment-dept@global-suppliers[.]net (actual source: 185.220.101.42, known malicious infrastructure). The email body uses urgency and payment themes to trick the recipient into opening the attachment: 'Your payment of $4,892.50 is overdue by 15 days. Please review the attached invoice immediately to avoid service interruption.' The ZIP archive contains heavily obfuscated JavaScript file 'Invoice_8821_Details.js' (SHA256: 02aa167e4bb41e3e40a75954f5a0bd5915f9a16fd6c21b544a557f2a7df3c89b) which is the first stage of PhantomVAI Loader infection chain. Email passed SPF checks but failed DMARC validation.",
