  "description": "Azure AD Identity Protection detected impossible travel for aisherlock@agentix.ad.bakerstreetlabs.io indicating credential compromise. Account authenticated from London (81.2.69.142) and Sydney (1.128.0.10) within 3.4 hours - requiring 4,975 km/h travel speed across 17,015 km distance (physically impossible). London session: Windows 10 laptop, Chrome browser, normal email/calendar access, registered corporate device LABS-WKS-221, successful MFA via Microsoft Authenticator. Sydney session: unregistered Android device (Samsung Galaxy), legacy auth protocol bypassing MFA (IMAP/POP3), immediate bulk OneDrive download (47 files, 127MB), suspicious Teams channel access. Sydney IP flagged in threat feeds for credential stuffing, shows VPN characteristics. Correlates with phishing site access (ebjv.com.au/filesharer) 4.4 hours prior, confirming credential theft vector. Risk score: Critical (98/100) - high confidence account compromise with active attacker usage.",
