  "description": "Suspicious RDP connection detected to workstation HR-WKS-089 (10.50.15.142) from external IP address 185.220.102.8 (TOR exit node, Romania). User account jsmith@victimcorp.local successfully authenticated after 3 failed login attempts within 2 minutes. This account belongs to HR manager Jennifer Smith who typically connects only from internal network (10.50.x.x range) during business hours (08:00-18:00 EST). The login occurred from a geographic location never seen before for this user. The session remained active for 47 minutes performing reconnaissance activities. This represents the initial foothold in what became a Medusa ransomware campaign. Investigation reveals the jsmith account credentials were previously compromised via credential stuffing attack targeting the company's VPN portal 72 hours earlier. Threat actor IP 185.220.102.8 matches known Medusa ransomware infrastructure from Unit 42 intelligence.",
