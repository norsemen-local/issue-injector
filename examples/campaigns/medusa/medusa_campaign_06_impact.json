  "description": "CRITICAL: Widespread ransomware deployment detected across VictimCorp infrastructure 43 minutes after data exfiltration completion. Medusa ransomware binary (medusa.exe, SHA256: 4d4df87cf8d8551d836f67fbde4337863bac3ff6b5cb324675054ea023b12ab6) executed simultaneously on 24 Windows servers including file servers, database servers, and domain controllers. Encryption started on FS-PROD-01 (10.50.20.10) and propagated via stolen Domain Admin credentials. The malware encrypted 15.7TB of data across 2,847,392 files with AES-256 encryption, appending .medusa extension to all encrypted files. Ransom note HOW_TO_RECOVER_FILES.txt deposited in every encrypted directory demanding 2.5 million USD in Bitcoin, with payment deadline of 72 hours before data publication on Medusa Blog leak site (medusakxxtp3uo7vusntvubnytaph4d3amxivbggl3hnhpk2nmus34yd.onion). The ransomware stopped 47 Windows services including SQL Server, Exchange, backup services, and VMware. Shadow copies were deleted using vssadmin.exe. All 24 affected systems displayed ransom wallpaper and locked workstations. Business operations completely halted. Total attack duration from initial RDP access to full encryption: 4 hours 16 minutes.",
