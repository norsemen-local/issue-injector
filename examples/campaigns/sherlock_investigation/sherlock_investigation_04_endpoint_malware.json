  "description": "Cortex XDR detected and blocked the execution of RedLine Stealer, a sophisticated credential harvesting malware, on endpoint SHERLOCK-WKS-01 associated with user aisherlock@bakerstreetlabs.io. The malware was delivered via a malicious executable (update_chrome.exe) masquerading as a legitimate Chrome browser update. The file was dropped in the user's Downloads folder (C:\\Users\\aisherlock\\Downloads\\update_chrome.exe) and executed at 2025-11-26 08:15:47 UTC. RedLine Stealer is a commodity information stealer sold on underground forums, designed to exfiltrate credentials from browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge), cryptocurrency wallets, FTP clients, email clients, and VPN configurations. Behavioral analysis detected multiple suspicious activities: 1) Process injection into legitimate Windows processes (explorer.exe, svchost.exe), 2) Registry modifications for persistence (HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run), 3) Memory scraping for stored credentials, 4) Network connections to known C2 infrastructure (185.141.62.123:443), 5) File enumeration across user directories targeting password databases and wallet files. The malware successfully harvested 173 stored credentials from Chrome password manager, 89 from Firefox, and 152 from Edge before Cortex XDR terminated the malicious process. File hash (SHA256: 8f3a2c91d7e4b5f6a1c2e3d4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4) matches known RedLine Stealer samples with VirusTotal detection rate of 52/72 engines. This infection is directly linked to the compromised user account and represents active data theft in progress. The threat actor successfully deployed malware 4 days after initial credential compromise, indicating escalation from account takeover to endpoint compromise.",

Force password reset for all credentials potentially harvested (173 Chrome + 89 Firefox + 152 Edge passwords). 3. Conduct full forensic imaging of the endpoint. 4. Reset all stored credentials including: browser passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, VPN credentials, FTP accounts. 5. Enable MFA on all accounts where credentials may have been stolen. 6. Monitor for unauthorized access using stolen credentials. 7. Block C2 infrastructure (185.141.62.123) at firewall level. 8. Scan all endpoints for RedLine Stealer IOCs. 9. Review user's recent file downloads and email attachments.",
