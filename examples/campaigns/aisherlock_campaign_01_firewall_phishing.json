  "description": "Palo Alto Networks firewall detected user aisherlock@agentix.ad.bakerstreetlabs.io accessing known phishing infrastructure at https://ebjv.com.au/filesharer from London office workstation. URL Filtering engine flagged the domain based on threat intelligence feeds identifying it as active credential phishing campaign targeting enterprises with fake file-sharing lures. Domain ebjv.com.au registered 7 days ago via Namecheap with Cloudflare nameservers, typical disposable phishing infrastructure. Site presents fake OneDrive/Dropbox credential prompt, capturing credentials via form POST to /auth/validate before redirecting to legitimate file to reduce suspicion. Firewall initially blocked access with warning, but user clicked 'Proceed Anyway' override, allowing TCP session to complete (47 seconds, 3.2KB uploaded suggesting credential submission). Threat intelligence correlates this domain with corporate credential harvesting campaigns. Subsequent authentication attempts to Office 365 from external IPs within 4 hours indicate successful credential theft and attacker usage.",
