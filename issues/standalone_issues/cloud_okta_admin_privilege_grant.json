  "description": "Okta administrator james.parker@company.com granted Super Administrator privileges to user account contractor_bob@company.com at 2024-11-27 06:34:18 UTC via Okta Admin Console. Super Administrator is the highest privilege level in Okta with full control over all tenant settings, applications, user accounts, and security policies. The target account contractor_bob@company.com is a contractor account with temporary access scheduled to expire in 14 days. The privilege assignment occurred from IP address 91.213.8.142 located in Ukraine, which is outside the organization's normal operational geography (United States). No change request or approval ticket exists for this privilege escalation in the ServiceNow ITSM system. This activity exhibits characteristics of an insider threat or account takeover where an attacker escalates privileges to establish persistence and maintain access to critical identity infrastructure. The super admin role assignment bypasses all conditional access policies and MFA requirements.",
