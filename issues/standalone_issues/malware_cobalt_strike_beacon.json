  "description": "Critical security incident: Cobalt Strike Beacon implant detected on endpoint belonging to user aiirene@agentix.ad.bakerstreetlabs.io. The sophisticated post-exploitation framework was deployed via reflective DLL injection into legitimate rundll32.exe process. Beacon established HTTPS communication with attacker team server, indicating advanced persistent threat (APT) activity. Memory analysis reveals active command execution capabilities, keylogging module, screenshot capture, and privilege escalation toolkit. This represents advanced stage of targeted attack with high likelihood of data exfiltration and lateral movement objectives.",
