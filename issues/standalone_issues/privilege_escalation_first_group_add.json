  "description": "User account helpdesk_tier1@company.local added user account temp_contractor@company.local to the Domain Admins privileged group on domain controller DC01.company.local at 2024-11-16 17:42:19 UTC. This is the first time in the account's 2-year history that helpdesk_tier1 has performed any privileged group membership modification. Helpdesk Tier 1 accounts typically have no permissions to modify Domain Admins membership and this action violates principle of least privilege. The temp_contractor account was created only 4 hours earlier and has no approval in the identity management system. Analysis shows helpdesk_tier1 account recently authenticated from two geographic locations simultaneously (New York and Moscow) indicating credential compromise. The group addition was performed using net.exe command-line utility rather than standard Active Directory Users and Computers MMC console. Event ID 4728 (Member added to security-enabled global group) was logged immediately before the action.",
