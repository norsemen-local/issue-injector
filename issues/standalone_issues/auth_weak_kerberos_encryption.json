  "description": "User account svc_backup@company.local requested a Kerberos Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket encrypted with RC4-HMAC (weak encryption) from domain controller DC01.company.local at 2024-11-27 11:22:15 UTC. The service principal name (SPN) requested was 'MSSQLSvc/db-prod-01.company.local:1433'. RC4 encryption is considered cryptographically weak and susceptible to offline brute-force attacks. This activity may indicate a Kerberoasting attack where an attacker with valid domain credentials requests service tickets to crack service account passwords offline. The requesting host WORKSTATION-457 (192.168.10.245) is not typically associated with this service account. Investigation revealed 47 similar weak encryption requests in the past 10 minutes from the same source.",
