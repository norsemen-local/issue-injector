  "description": "Next-Generation Firewall detected encrypted C2 beacon communications from FIN-WKS-087 to known AdaptixC2 command-and-control server tech-system[.]online (104.21.78[.]134:443). Advanced Threat Prevention analysis identifies sophisticated C2 protocol mimicking legitimate HTTPS/TLS 1.3 traffic patterns to evade detection: (1) Valid SSL certificate for tech-system[.]online issued by Let's Encrypt, (2) HTTP/2 protocol with proper ALPN negotiation, (3) User-Agent spoofing mimicking 'Microsoft-Delivery-Optimization/10.1' (Windows Update component), (4) Traffic timing follows normal distribution with 60\u00b112 second intervals, (5) Request sizes randomized 1.2-3.8KB matching Windows telemetry patterns. Deep packet inspection despite encryption reveals behavioral signatures: (1) Consistent URI pattern /endpoint/api/v2/beacon with Base64-encoded POST data, (2) TLS session resumption preventing full handshake analysis, (3) Server responses 200-500 bytes containing encrypted taskings, (4) No bidirectional traffic outside beacon intervals (classic C2 pattern). SSL decryption analysis (enterprise proxy) decodes beacon structure: JSON-formatted heartbeat containing system information (hostname: FIN-WKS-087, username: rbrown, domain: financialcorp.com, OS: Windows 11 Enterprise 23H2, privileges: standard user, installed AV: Microsoft Defender + Cortex XDR, last activity timestamp, beacon ID: f47e9ac3-8b2d-4a1f-9e6c-3d5f8b2a7c9e). Threat intelligence correlation: tech-system[.]online registered 2025-05-07 (3 days before campaign), hosted on Cloudflare CDN for resilience and obfuscation, domain categorized as 'uncategorized' bypassing URL filtering, no passive DNS history indicating fresh infrastructure. Firewall policy matched rule 'Block-Unknown-C2' but allowed initial connection due to valid SSL and legitimate User-Agent before threat feed updated. Network flow analysis shows: 47 beacon exchanges over 48 minutes, total data exfiltrated 138KB, received tasking commands 23KB. Behavioral analysis suggests C2 implementing: system reconnaissance, credential harvesting preparation, lateral movement planning. AdaptixC2 framework documentation confirms beacon protocol designed specifically to evade SSL inspection and mimic Windows Update traffic.",
