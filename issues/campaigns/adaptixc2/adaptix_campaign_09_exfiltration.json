  "description": "Next-Generation Firewall detected massive encrypted data exfiltration from compromised workstation FIN-WKS-087 to AdaptixC2 command-and-control infrastructure tech-system[.]online, representing culmination of multi-stage attack campaign. Network traffic analysis identifies abnormal upload volume 34.2MB transmitted over 18-minute window (05:38 AM - 05:56 AM) via HTTPS POST requests to /endpoint/api/v2/upload URI, contrasting with normal beacon traffic baseline of 1-4KB per request. Deep packet inspection reveals sophisticated exfiltration protocol designed to evade DLP: (1) Data chunked into 2MB segments uploaded sequentially, (2) Each chunk wrapped in legitimate-appearing JSON structure mimicking Windows telemetry format, (3) Base64 encoding applied to encrypted 7z archive before transmission, (4) HTTP/2 multiplexing across 8 concurrent streams maximizing throughput, (5) Server ACK responses include next-chunk tokens maintaining session state, (6) Upload timing randomized with 30-90 second intervals between chunks preventing bandwidth spike detection, (7) Traffic pattern mimics Windows Update delta package uploads. Firewall threat intelligence correlation identified tech-system[.]online as known AdaptixC2 infrastructure during transfer (mid-session threat feed update), however SSL inspection bypass via certificate pinning prevented real-time blocking. Network flow metadata analysis: Source FIN-WKS-087:54782 \u2192 Destination 104.21.78[.]134:443 (Cloudflare CDN front-end), total uploaded 35.9MB (34.2MB payload + 1.7MB protocol overhead), 17 successful chunk transfers completed, connection maintained 18 minutes 42 seconds, average throughput 32.1 KB/s (throttled to avoid detection), bidirectional flow 36.1MB up / 187KB down. Threat intelligence indicates uploaded data staged at attacker-controlled exfiltration server behind Cloudflare infrastructure, likely immediate transfer to dark web marketplace or ransomware negotiation leverage. Data loss impact assessment based on staging alert correlation: 127 files containing material non-public information (unreleased Q4 2025 earnings: revenue $847M), merger/acquisition intelligence ($125M DataSecure acquisition), PII (employee SSNs, customer payment data), executive compensation details. Regulatory implications: SEC material cybersecurity incident disclosure requirement (4-day deadline), mandatory breach notification (GDPR Article 33: 72 hours, state breach laws), potential insider trading investigation if MNPI disclosed prior to earnings announcement. EDR correlation confirms exfiltration source as staged archive system_backup_20250510.7z, file deleted from FIN-WKS-087 immediately post-transfer using SDelete secure wipe (anti-forensics).",
