  "description": "Cortex XDR detected critical security incident on workstation FIN-WKS-087 where user rbrown@financialcorp.com launched Microsoft Quick Assist remote assistance tool (quickassist.exe) 8 minutes after receiving external Microsoft Teams message from unverified 'IT Support' contact. Process telemetry shows quickassist.exe (C:\\Windows\\System32\\quickassist.exe, PID 9247) launched via Windows Run dialog (parent process: explorer.exe PID 3891) at 03:58 AM, establishing outbound HTTPS connection to Microsoft Quick Assist relay servers (relay.support.services.microsoft.com, 20.190.160.1) for remote session initiation. Behavioral analysis identified suspicious session characteristics: (1) Launch timestamp 03:58 AM outside normal business hours, (2) No corresponding IT ticketing system entry for remote support request, (3) External Teams contact 'IT Support | External' not in corporate directory, (4) User manually entered 6-digit session code 734-892 received via Teams chat (clipboard monitoring detected code copy-paste from Teams.exe to quickassist.exe), (5) Session established with unknown remote party IP 103.224.182[.]45 (Singapore, bulletproof hosting ASN). EDR correlation shows temporal relationship: Teams message received 03:50 AM \u2192 User clicked phishing link 03:51 AM \u2192 QuickAssist downloaded 03:52 AM \u2192 Session code entered 03:58 AM \u2192 Remote connection established 03:59 AM. Quick Assist session granted attacker SYSTEM-level privileges via User Account Control (UAC) bypass (legitimate Quick Assist feature abuse), enabling full system control without additional exploits. Network forensics reveal session duration 47 minutes (03:59 AM - 04:46 AM), during which attacker downloaded multiple PowerShell scripts to %TEMP% directory. Behavioral Threat Protection flagged activity based on: RMM tool launch following external Teams contact, off-hours usage, lack of IT authorization, connection to suspicious foreign IP, unusual UAC elevation requests.",
