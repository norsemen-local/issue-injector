  "description": "Palo Alto Networks firewall PA-5220-FW01 detected command-and-control communication from compromised government web server WEB-PROD-03 (10.30.25.112) to known BadIIS C2 infrastructure 404.008php[.]com (103.6.235[.]26:80) for retrieving SEO poisoning payloads. Network behavior analysis identified suspicious HTTP POST request from WEB-PROD-03 with custom User-Agent header 'IIS-Module/8.5' (non-standard for legitimate web traffic) containing encoded victim information in request body: Base64-encoded JSON payload {'target': 'govagency.vn', 'requester': 'Googlebot/2.1', 'keywords': ['xoi lac tv', 'ca cuoc bong da'], 'timestamp': 1711084920}. C2 server 404.008php[.]com responded with HTTP 200 OK containing 47KB malicious HTML payload (Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8) designed for search engine indexing. Deep packet inspection revealed response body contains: 187 hyperlinks to gambling/scam domains, Vietnamese keyword stuffing (279 instances of illegal streaming terms), hidden iframe pointing to tracking pixel (hxxps://track.analytics-cdn[.]net/pixel.gif?cid=CL-UNK-1037), obfuscated JavaScript for browser fingerprinting. SSL/TLS analysis shows C2 connection using standard HTTPS (port 443 fallback) with valid Let's Encrypt certificate for 404.008php[.]com, domain registered 2025-02-14 via NameCheap with privacy protection (WHOIS hidden). Threat intelligence correlation: IP 103.6.235[.]26 hosted on AS-CHOOPA (Vultr cloud provider, U.S.) but known to host CL-UNK-1037 infrastructure for Southeast Asian targeting campaigns. C2 communication pattern: BadIIS module checks for search engine crawler \u2192 sends POST to C2 with victim metadata \u2192 receives customized HTML \u2192 serves to crawler \u2192 waits 60-120 seconds \u2192 repeats. Traffic volume analysis shows 47 C2 connections in 3-hour window, averaging 1 connection every 3.8 minutes, indicating active automated SEO poisoning campaign. Firewall Advanced Threat Prevention engine flagged traffic as 'badii' malware family with Critical severity based on C2 behavioral signatures.",
